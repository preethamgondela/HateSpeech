Final_code.ipynb is the main file that consists of training the model with various datasets.

The complete process and details of our project is summarized in details.txt.

Apart from the Final_code.ipynb to further analyze the multilinguality we trained our model using 3 different languages other 
than the languages given in the paper and at last we tested the multilinguality by testing the model with a test dataset of french language.
You can find that code in Multilingual(1).ipynb.
